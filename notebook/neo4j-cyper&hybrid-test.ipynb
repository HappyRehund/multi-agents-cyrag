    "        2. Do not use EXISTS, SIZE, HAVING keywords in the cypher. Use alias when using the WITH keyword\n",

    "        5. Never use relationships that are not mentioned in the given schema\n",
    "        6. For all node labels and relationship types, add namespace prefix `ns0__` before the actual label or relationship type. E.g., `MATCH (n:ns0__NodeLabel)-[:ns0__RelationshipType]->(m:ns0__NodeLabel)`.\n",
    "        7. Node properties with `created`, `description`, `identifier`, `modified`, `title` and `version`, add prefix `ns1__` instead. E.g., `MATCH (n:ns0__NodeLabel) RETURN n.ns1__title AS Title`.\n",
    "        8. Always do a case-insensitive and fuzzy search for any properties related search. Eg: to search for a Tactic, use `toLower(Tactic.ns1__title) contains 'persistence'`.\n",

    "        10. Never return components not explicitly named in the MATCH clause.\n",
    "        11. In the RETURN clause, include all named components (nodes, relationships, or properties) to ensure consistency and understanding.\n",
    "        12. Always return all the nodes used in the MATCH clause to provide complete information to the user.\n",
    "        13. When counting distinct items that come from an `OPTIONAL MATCH`, prefer to `collect()` them first and then use `size()` on the collected list to avoid warnings about null values. For example, instead of `count(DISTINCT optional_item)`, use `WITH main_node, collect(DISTINCT optional_item) AS items` and then in the `RETURN` clause use `size(items) AS itemCount`.\n",
    "        14. To create unique pairs of nodes for comparison (e.g., for similarity calculations), use the `elementId()` function instead of the deprecated `id()` function. For example: `WHERE elementId(node1) < elementId(node2)`.\n",
