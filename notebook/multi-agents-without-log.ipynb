    "        2. Do not use EXISTS, SIZE, HAVING keywords in the cypher. Use alias when using the WITH keyword\n",
    "        3. Use only Nodes and relationships mentioned in the schema\n",
    "        5. Never use relationships that are not mentioned in the given schema\n",
    "        6. For all node labels and relationship types, add namespace prefix `ns0__` before the actual label or relationship type. E.g., `MATCH (n:ns0__NodeLabel)-[:ns0__RelationshipType]->(m:ns0__NodeLabel)`.\n",
    "        7. Node properties with `created`, `description`, `identifier`, `modified`, `title` and `version`, add prefix `ns1__` instead. E.g., `MATCH (n:ns0__NodeLabel) RETURN n.ns1__title AS Title`.\n",
    "        8. Always do a case-insensitive and fuzzy search for any properties related search. Eg: to search for a Tactic, use `toLower(Tactic.ns1__title) contains 'persistence'`.\n",
    "        9. Always assign a meaningful name to every node and relationship in the MATCH clause\n",
    "        10. Never return components not explicitly named in the MATCH clause.\n",
    "        11. In the RETURN clause, include all named components (nodes, relationships, or properties) to ensure consistency and understanding.\n",
    "        12. Always return all the nodes used in the MATCH clause to provide complete information to the user.\n",
    "        13. When counting distinct items that come from an `OPTIONAL MATCH`, prefer to `collect()` them first and then use `size()` on the collected list to avoid warnings about null values. For example, instead of `count(DISTINCT optional_item)`, use `WITH main_node, collect(DISTINCT optional_item) AS items` and then in the `RETURN` clause use `size(items) AS itemCount`.\n",
    "        14. To create unique pairs of nodes for comparison (e.g., for similarity calculations), use the `elementId()` function instead of the deprecated `id()` function. For example: `WHERE elementId(node1) < elementId(node2)`.\n",

      "Initial Access consists of techniques that adversaries may use as entry vectors to gain an initial foothold within an ICS environment. These techniques include compromising operational technology assets, IT resources in the OT network, and external remote services and websites. They may also target third party entities and users with privileged access. In particular, these initial access footholds may include devices and communication mechanisms with access to and privileges in both the IT and OT environments. IT resources in the OT environment are also potentially vulnerable to the same attacks as enterprise IT systems. Trusted third parties of concern may include vendors, maintenance personnel, engineers, external integrators, and other outside entities involved in expected ICS operations. Vendor maintained assets may include physical devices, software, and operational equipment. Initial access techniques may also leverage outside devices, such as radios, controllers, or removable media, to remotely interfere with and possibly infect OT operations.\n",

      "The information from the Vector Search provides a comprehensive list of mitigation actions for the attack technique \"Credential Access\" within ICS environments. It highlights the importance of user authentication and additional security controls, offering specific mitigations such as multi-factor authentication and account management policies. Although the Cypher Query did not provide any data, the Vector Search context sufficiently covers the necessary mitigation strategies. However, the focus is primarily on ICS environments, and there may be additional considerations for other types of environments not covered in the provided data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the attack technique \"Credential Access,\" especially in ICS environments, it is crucial to implement strong user authentication, preferably multi-factor authentication, although this may not always be feasible. Additional recommended mitigations include establishing robust account use policies, password policies, user account management, privileged account management, and user account control. These measures help protect against adversaries exploiting software vulnerabilities for remote service abuse and initial access. While the provided data focuses on ICS environments, these strategies are broadly applicable and can be adapted to other environments as needed.\n"
